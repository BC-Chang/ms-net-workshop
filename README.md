## MS-Net: Computationally Efficient Multiscale Neural Network 

Implementation of <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11242-021-01617-y">The MS-Net</a> in Pytorch. This model provides an easy and effcient way to train neural networks with computationally large 3D arrays. The application shown in the paper considered simulations of flow thorugh porous materials, but the method is genral and should be applicable to any other application that involves 3D arrays.
